 Prisma Client is a query builder that composes the way you think and gets auto-generated from the Prisma schema with types tailored to your app. We designed the API to be intuitive for both SQL veterans and people brand new to databases.
 Based on the Prisma Schema, Prisma Migrate automatically generates SQL database migrations, that are fully customizable. For quick data model prototyping in development,prisma db push lets you make changes to the database without generating migration files.
